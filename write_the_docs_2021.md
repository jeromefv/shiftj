# Google's Season of Docs is the "Write" Opportunity

## Introduction

We are Jeremiah Telzrow and Jerome Villegas, and together we run a team called shift J. Our mission is to foster community within the technical and UX writing profession by connecting new and less-experienced writers with those established in the field. We do this via sessions at industry conferences, conducting interviews with people working in the field, blog posts, and social media. 

## Plan

For Write the Docs Portland 2021 we propose to moderate a discussion with participants in the 2020 Google Season of Docs (GSoD). Our session will explore their experience, with an eye on offering unique and valuable insights to WtD attendees who are curious about or planning to apply. Our guest will be Ryan Cooper, PhD, Assistant Professor-in-Residence at the University of Connecticut. Co-founder from shift J,  Jerome Villegas, also participated in GSoD in 2020 and he will add his experience and observations. Our discussion will cover general topics, avoiding any deep technical aspects of the work. Ryan and Jerome will field questions in the live Q&A session. 

### Sample questions/discussion topics:
- What was your application experience like? 
- How did you interact with your team?
- How did you get your assignment? 
- Who did you go to for help when you needed it? 
- What were the working hours like?
- Did you feel like the program prepared you for work in the field? How so? 
- Did you get to know any other GSoD participants? 

Ryan Cooper, PhD. is an Assistant Professor-in-Residence at the University of Connecticut. His GSoD work focused on organizing, editing, and building additional documentation for the NumPy open source Python library. 

## Conclusion

Write the Docs (and the tech and UX writing community as a whole) is a welcoming space where established professionals and just-starting-out writers mingle, network, and share highs and lows of working in the technical and UX writing industry. Our shift J sessions tap into that culture, providing a space for new and emerging writers to ask questions and connect with leaders in our field. Our proposal for WtD Portland 2021 builds on our community-focused approach, offering attendees an up-close and fresh perspective on Google’s popular Season of Docs program.

### Who and Why
- Who is this talk for? What background knowledge or experience do you expect the audience to have? What is the take away from the talk?
    - The right opportunity for a technical writer is different for everyone. In this talk, we explore the varying levels of experience and how open source is an excellent avenue to pursue for getting started or growing your network. Anyone interested in technical communication from those who are considering the field to those already established in the industry benefit from learning more about the processes behind these GSoD participants. We believe that the value of sharing our approaches, problem-solving skills, and resourcefulness inspires people to continue in their missions of developing content to help people.

    - Our conference hosting experience includes sessions at the UX Writer’s Conference in June 2020, Write the Docs Portland 2020 (Unconference space), and the UX Writer’s Conference in October 2020, where our panel drew more than 90 people—over 35% of that day’s attendees.
